# Chosen Topic: Wedding Website

## Description


In this final, "Capstone" project, you'll bring together everything you've learned to create your own web application. You'll need to build all aspects of the site including an interactive front end. On the backend you'll manage data with a database and talk to at least two other web sites by connecting to their APIs. Finally, you'll host this site on the web so the world can see your finished, running web application.

You can build this project using any of the technologies you've learned so far such as React, and the MEAN stack, a relational database like MySQL, a document-based database like MongoDB, Bootstrap, jQuery, Express, and Node. Please don't use backend frameworks that we haven't taught in the Techdegree, such as Koa, Sails, or Meteor. You can use any front end libraries and frameworks.


## Requirements


- Sign up for hosting: Heroku and mLab (my choices)
- Set up your JavaScript-powered web app
  - Build your app using any of the technologies or application frameworks you've learned so far such as React, the MEAN Stack, Express, and Node.js
- Connect to at least two APIs
  - Display data from at least two other web sites by connecting to their APIs
- Front end design and layout
  - Use a responsive front end framework like Bootstrap to style your app
  - You can add your own custom CSS to give your app a unique look
- Manage your app's data with a database
  - Use a relational database like MySQL
  - Or use a document-based data store like MongoDB
- Check for issues with your JavaScript code using JSHint, linked in the project resources
  - JSHint may show you some warnings, so make sure to check through those for any potential problems
  - You do not need to fix every warning listed but reviewing them can be useful
- Put your project in a new GitHub repository on your GitHub account
- App portability
  - Your app should run successfully after running npm install and npm start in a local clone of the GitHub repository
- Deploy your project
  - Make your application available at a public URL, and submit the URL for review
- Check your project for cross browser compatibility.


## Extra Credit


- Use more than two APIs in your app
- Write custom CSS to layout and style your app further than the default Bootstrap style
- Use HTML5 validation to make sure that required fields are filled out and input is formatted correctly
- Write unit tests for your code using Mocha.js and an assertion library like Chai
